I. Introduction
A. Robert Cole claims that propaganda is the “selection, arrangement, and presentation of information for the purpose of eliciting desired public responses – responses that might not be rational or responsible” (Cole, 621). (RFP p12)
B. Propaganda is deliberate manipulation of one’s perception of a social group or idea.” (RFP p21) 
C. “Propaganda seeks to make its audience feel rather than think.” (RFP p27)

II. The 1940s
A. State of propaganda at end of WWII
1. A cartoon illustrates the belief that Bolshevism was not actually an economic system but a political system that was designed to bring about chaos. (RFP p14)
2. During the 1940s and 50s, people were trained to see communism in almost everything. (RFP p17)
3. During WWII, prop was used to gather troops for the U.S. military by stirring fervor for the campaign to protect democracy abroad. After WWII it grew into a much more complicated and systematic industry.
4. Directly after WWII the American public was notably anti-propaganda due in part to the over-use of propaganda by the Nazis, Facists and communists. The OWI was largely shut down. (APA p20)

B. Shift of propaganda styles and techniques 
1. Propaganda industry of the United States truly began to flourish after America introduced a policy of open censorship. SGW p99.
2. After World War II and during the beginning of the Red Scare, propaganda began to change from a way to protect international ideologies to a means of promoting domestic government ideologies. SGW pg110
3. In one case, a government document equated psychological warfare with such weapons as “the airplane, the 155 millimeter gun, the Patton tank and the bazooka.” RP pg57
4. Despite originally intended to keep peace, propaganda eventually became a key tool in bringing about the end of communism. RP pg172
5. During the Red Scare, propaganda became more extracted from its goals, often both promoting the anti-communist movement and denouncing communism. Frequently propaganda would even praise the propaganda industry in a way solidifying its perceived truthfulness and making it more difficult to distinguish propaganda from the rest of the media. 
6. Early Cold War propaganda involved copious descriptions of America’s prosperity to foreign nations but this campaign failed, only creating anger and resentment. (APA p24)
7. As the Cold War progressed and began to develop more concrete wars against Soviet satellites, the American propaganda system began to merge with psychological warfare. (APA p28)
8. In the early stages of the Cold War, America engaged in several projects to raise its appeal to smaller countries, such as the Food for Peace program, which gave away surplus food. They weren’t as effective as predicted. (APA p34)

III. Mediums
A. Despite Soviet attempts to block transmissions, American propaganda radio was still capable of reaching the territories of the U.S.S.R. The inhabitants of those areas were encouraged to rebel again the Soviet regime, which the radio programs painted as oppressive and unjust. SOL pg47
B. With advances in America’s technological capabilities, the possible mediums for propaganda expanded to include radio, television and others. RP pg184

A. It was not uncommon for the U.S. government to utilize ex-communists and Soviet Russian immigrants for anti-Soviet propaganda production. RP pg93

G. During the Red Scare it was a common belief that anyone who spoke out against capitalism or for communism in any way intended to eradicate capitalism and globalize communism.

Anyone showing remote interest in the politics of communism was labeled an anti-patriotic insurgent. (NDR p157)

O. John A Stormer claims that many factions of the communist movement during the Red Scare were closely linked with conservative Christian institutions.  (NDR p141)
P. “Communism is a disease of the intellect. It promises universal brotherhood, peace and prosperity to lure humanitarians and idealists into participating in a conspiracy which gains power through deceit and deception and stays in power with brute force.” (NDR p16)
Q. Even as the press continued to grow more fearful of communist regimes, people worried that the press might be communist sympathizers. “Edward R. Murrow …, Howard K. Smith …, and Chet Huntley … have, by their associations, writing, and actions, marked themselves as biased liberals.” (NDR p146)
R. The purpose of many congressional hearings was not actually to seek out and punish communists who intended to overthrow the government but rather to foster fear of people who might want to do so.

They juxtaposed good and bad propaganda, not so much in terms of a mirror showcase metaphor, but in terms of the source of the information: the United States disseminated truth while the Soviet Union espoused lies.” RP p17
3. While American propaganda was considered necessary by the government, foreign propaganda, particularly from the Soviet Block, was perceived as a threat. Dupes p9
4. There was a common bias in the US government and the general public during the red Scare that American propaganda was necessary for preserving democracy while foreign propaganda posed a threat to the American way of life. Dupes p.17
